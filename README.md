# Odin_Recipes

A practice exercise for making a HTML and CSS based recipe website.

This is the first HTML / CSS Excercise introduced to us in the Learning Fundamentals course as is part of The Odin Project.

This website showcases my current skills in the two languages which I have accumulated before starting learning with The Odin Project. It is a very basic website which has dummy text as the website content and 6 separate web pages. The website makes use of links, ordered and unodered lists, some basin CSS styling, embedded stock images taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and some tables.
